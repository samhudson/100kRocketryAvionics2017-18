\section {Purpose and Goals}
The Spaceport America 100k rocketry challenge is a contest in which the Oregon State University chapter if the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics is competing. The rocket is being designed and created by an interdisciplinary team of engineering seniors, from both the school of mechanical industrial and manufacturing engineering and the school of electrical engineering and computer science. The 18 person team contains engineering students from various disciplines, combining their skills to create, launch and track a high altitude rocket. The goal is for the rocket to exceed 100,000 feet in altitude. The specific goal of the computer science sub-team is to develop software to effectively track the rocket, successfully recover it, and to visualize its flight path. \par
\section {Current Progress} 
The first term of this year was spent on research and design. We have identified what our software must do, the appropriate tools to utilize, and we have a solid strategy in place for how to make the system. This time was far from wasted, as design is just as important as implementation, and taking the time to understand the problems more fully will lead to a better product. This does mean however that we have little to no actual code as of this moment. There have been proof of concepts done for the 3D trace and the 2D visualization, but nothing concrete has been written. \\
While having concrete code would be a good milestone to have reached this term, it is not a problem. The system is designed, a testing plan in place, and work evenly divided. Over the course of the winter holiday and the winter term of the school year the entire system can be created and tested, thanks to the time spent on adequate design. \par

 Positives & Deltas & Actions \\

 The AIAA general meetings and the sub-team meetings every week gave us two extra chances beyond the class room to meet and discuss what was needed both within our group and in relation to the other sub-teams. & While the meetings were helpful, they would be far more effective if all group members were there for the majority of the meetings. The group work we do we must also begin at earlier times, as some of our projects were completed far too close to the time they were due. & Better communication and panning can be achieved by using a project management tool. We can better plan out our work and then have access to those plans at any time. There should also be a set number of meetings you can miss per term, such as two, and you have to inform at least one other group member at least an hour in advance. \\

\begin {itemize}
 \item \textbf{Plans: }Find projects that interest me. 
 \item \textbf{Problems: }We are having trouble getting in touch with the professor in charge of the AIAA 100k challenge team. 
 \item \textbf{Progress: }I have discovered an opportunity to be on the 100k rocket challenge avionics team. I have been to the first two meetings and it looks very interesting and challenging.  
 \item \textbf{Summary: }Summary: This week I started out not certain as to what projects I would be interested in. I was searching through them for a day or two and then I was presented with the chance to visit the first meeting of the AIAA 100k challenge. I have been taken onto the team for almost certain. I am excited for this challenge and I look forward to it as we have already started to collaborate, brainstorm and review last years work to develop a plan for improvements and revisions.

 \item \textbf{Plans: }Go to AIAA meeting and introduce ourselves to client
 \item \textbf{Problems: }We are having trouble scheduling all of us at the same time for meetings.
 \item \textbf{Progress: }We have met the client in person and sent an introduction email. We still need to work on scheduling for all three of us. 
 \item \textbf{Summary: }This week we focused on contacting the client and the other capstones groups e needed to contact as this is an interdisciplinary project. The client offered us requirements adjustments if necessary later in the year, to accommodate the fact that the other teams have deliverables in the winter. We attended an AIAA meeting and presented our team's mission to other undergraduates in the hopes they may get involved.

 \item \textbf{Progress: }We have met the client in person and were given some idea. Spoke with McGrath about this as well. I have written the rough draft of my Problem Statement. GitHub set up. 
 \item \textbf{Summary: }This week we focused on the problem statements. We have rough drafts for each of us and The GitHub is now live. We invited both McGrath and Winters as collaborators. There is still some polish to be done on my rough draft of the problem statement. The expectations of us are still very vague at this point but McGrath expects this and I am doing my best with my team to come up with reasonable promises, as well as some things we would like to do.

 \item \textbf{Problems: }We are not certain how to make this a 10,000 foot view of the problem. We are getting a bit too technical in our description. 
 \item \textbf{Progress: }We have received feedback and have edited some parts of the description. We decided we need no money. We also wrote an outreach statement. 
 \item \textbf{Summary: }This week we focused on writing the problem statement and the outreach statement for AIAA. I have also personally looked more into Kalman filters and I have found some books I may want to buy or check for at the library.

 \item \textbf{Summary: }This week we focused on the requirements document. We are trying to get in contact with our client, but being as busy as she is it is understandable that she has not gotten in contact with us. We are going to keep trying, we will submit what we have and hopefully, seeing as I have talked with Kirsten and emailed both her and Kevin, if changes are needed we can make them.
